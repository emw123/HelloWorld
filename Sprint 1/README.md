# Overview

While writing this software I used several different examples of programs and styles. This program is not meant to be one 
comprehensive program, but rather many small programs that demostrate the various different ways to make a program in C++ 
function.

My purpose in writing this software is to gain a better understanding od how C++ works, as well as learn more about it's similarities to other languages that I have previously learned.
