# Overview

For this project I wrote several different functions demonstrating the different
processes within the Java languages, including examples of variables, functions,
expressions, conditionals, loops, and data structures.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio code with Java extentions to complete this project.
I used Java as the only language, since it was the only lanaguage that I 
was seeking to demonstrate.
