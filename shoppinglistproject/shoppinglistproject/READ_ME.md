# Overview

I wrote a web application that creates a simple shopping list dynamically through 
python, django, html and css. My purpose in writing this software was to familiarize
myself with django syntax as well as create a simple but useful tool.

# Web Pages

I created two html pages. One was shoppinglist.html, where the page had an input box and 
a button that would place the input into a list. It would then diplay the list items and 
give the option of removing them from the list if desired. The second page content.html,
meant to extend the process of shoppinglist.html and run through the same process using block
elements. I was unable to make the process work in this way, and was forced to run it all through
shoppinglist.html.

# Development Environment

I used Django to make this software. In addition to Django, I used python, css and html.
I used these tools to create a dynamic web app that calls various views and paths
from Django to create a list based on user input.
